# Handlers

## List of currently implemented Handlers

## Development

To write new handlers, one has to implement the `PackageHandler` interface
defined in `pkg/controller/controller.go`.
After that, the handler can be registered in `app/cmd/cmd.go`.

The interface should be well enough described to get going. Some
informal conventions, especially on logging:
As the controller has not parsed the package and only delegates
the work, the handler should be logging it's actions accordingly.
This means:
For every action, on every package, log accordingly. Example:
Installing package X and Y should output something like:

```
output.Info("ðŸ“¦ [HandlerName]\tInstalling Package %s", pkg)
```

On a successful operation, log accordingly, too:

```
output.Success("ðŸ“¦ [HandlerName]\tUpgraded Package %s", pkg)
```

Do not log errors if the function returns the error. Instead,
use `errors.Wrapf` to add context to the error.

If you are processing multiple packages, use the `collection`
package. It allows to collect multiple errors, merge errors
together and more. This way, try to work through all the given
packages before returning an error.

See the `goget` directory for an example handler.
